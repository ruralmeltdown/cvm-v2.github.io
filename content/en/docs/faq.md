**Q:** How reliable is this?  
**A:** Coverage grows as more nodes are introduced into the network. More permanent nodes help the network even more.

**Q:** Do I need a license or tech skills?  
**A:** No license is needed at all. Tech know-how is a bonus, but not needed either.

**Q:** Where can I get help?  
**A:** Our community on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/9KUu5QQqMx), or any of the other [Meshtastic communities](https://meshtastic.org/docs/community/local-groups/), or at [Meshtastic.org](https://www.Meshtastic.org)

**Q:** How much does this cost?  
**A:** The only cost is the hardware and your time.

**Q:** Do I have to use my real name?  
**A:** No. You can remain anonymous if you choose. Just follow the community guidelines or your node will be disabled from the network.

**Q:** What does RSSI and SNR mean?  
**A:** Meshtastic gear gives you two key signal stats: RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator) and SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio).
