This is the **builds** section. There are two categories: [Community](/builds/community) and [Personal](/builds/personal).

- [Community](/builds/community) builds are ones that service the broader Meshtastic community, with some examples being: 
    - self-sustaining deployments on public/private lands
    - Home-based long-range repeaters
    - and more...

- [Personal](/builds/personal) builds are ones that are solely consumed by an individual for their own enjoyment/use.

To create a new build post, please connect with us in the `Builds` or `Website` channels of our [Discord community](https://discord.gg/9KUu5QQqMx) or submit a PR on our site's [Github](https://github.com/CentralValleyMesh/centralvalleymesh.github.io/).

Posts are below, and listed in reverse chronological order.
